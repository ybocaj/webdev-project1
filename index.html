            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>I graduated college back in 2004 and I've worked for a few
                software companies since graduation. I have mostly worked as
                a Software Specialist, QA Tester, and Analyst, using various
                tools to troubleshoot and ultimately resolve issues.</p>

            <p>My plan is to learn code so I can be a web developer, software
                engineer, or even a QA engineer (do some whitebox testing).</p>

            <p>I probably should have began this path 30 years ago, but I
                hope it's not too late to get hired, because learning code
                is hard, but fun.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I aim to be really good at programming to where my current
                struggles are something I can look back and laugh at. I'm
                looking to increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:
            </p>
            <ul class="skills">
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Python</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                My ultimate goal would be to latch on with a company that
                will allow for growth. I wouldn't mind getting a job working
                on the front-end, with HTML and CSS, eventually Javascript.
                As I learn more, I'd like to work on the back-end, with
                Python and whatever other languages I learn.
