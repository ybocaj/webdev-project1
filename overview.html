                <h1>Project 1 Overview</h1>
            </header>
            <p>For your first project, you’ll practice web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile. You'll
            modify the code for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, and a stylish design. This is a great way for you
            to practice HTML and CSS skills. It also gives you a web page you can use as a personal online calling card to advertise
            your experience, skills, and goals, and to provide links to your social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub.</p>

            <p>You'll also practice using GitHub, an important tool used by millions of developers to share code and work
            collaboratively on programming projects. Creating and using a GitHub account is also a great way to share your work with
            potential employers.</p>

            <h2>Before you start</h2>
            <p>To prepare for this project you'll need to make sure you complete and understand these steps.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Complete the Unit 1 Curriculum</strong>. The courses, workshops, and instruction steps in each unit are designed to help prepare you for completing the project.
                You are encouraged to take your time reviewing this material, pausing the videos as needed so you can build alongside
                the instructor.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a GitHub Repo</strong>. Each Techdegree project needs its own GitHub repo that you’ll use to submit your finished project. A project repo should
                only contain the project starter files plus any code and/or files you need to add to make the project run. If you need a
                reminder on how to use GitHub and GitHub Desktop, please refer to the <a target=_blank href="GitHub Desktop Reference">Github Desktop Reference</a>.
                <ul><strong>Pro Tip</strong>. A preferred developer workflow is to create a new repo when you begin a project, and then make regular updates to the
                repo after important changes and at key stages of development, like after adding new files or implementing new
                functionality.</ul>
                <li><strong>Download the Project Files</strong>. Download the project files in the “Download Files” section on the right-hand side of this page, just above “Project
                Resources”. Once unzipped, the file and folder structure of the project directory should not be changed.</li>
            </ol>
