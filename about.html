            <h3>Career Choices</h3>
            <p>When I was little, I wanted to be a professional baseball player.  When that didn't pan out, I meandered through life, working odd jobs.  But 
                I liked working on computers. I was the guy people asked to fix their PCs or write up papers, print em, etc..</p>
            <p>So I got a job with an internet startup, which led to a tech support position.</p>
            <p>While in college, I worked as a computer operator.  Upon graduating, I got a job as a support rep with a software company.   
            </p>
            <p>Now being laid off twice, I realize the volatility, but I also learned the importance of developers, because some of them were the last to go.
                And others I knew helped struggling companies modernize their software.  
            </p>

            <h3>Personal</h3>
            <p>On the personal side, I own 2 cats, I like to golf, ride my motorcycle, play video games, and I hope to move further 
                South or even out of the country someday.  I definitely want to travel and I've never been out of the country, so 
                Ireland (my Nationality), Greece, and New Zealand are a few places I'd like to go to visit ancestors, stay for awhile, 
                swim in a warm, blue ocean, and play some golf.
            </p>
            <p>I've always wanted to own a Porsche and I also hope to buy a Ducati Panigale someday.  Those are the materialistic things I want.</p>
            <p>I've never been married and quite frankly I'm hard to please and I can't see spending the rest of my life with 1 person.  I haven't had 
                a lot of stability in my life due to being laid off twice in the past 20 years, so I need to take care of myself before I can take care of 
                anyone else.  So we'll see how all that plays out.
