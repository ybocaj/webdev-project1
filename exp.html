                <h3>CMA</h3>
                <p>I graduated from Portland State in 2004, and got my first post-degree job later that year, working as a Support
                    Specialist for Content Management Associates in Oregon City. I was surprised I was hired, because they worked with
                    SQL and I hadn't ever used that, but they taught me and I used SQL daily, writing insert, update, and delete queries
                    to resolve issues. As I got better with joining tables, I wrote billable reports in which I extrapolated data for
                    clients.</p>
                <p>I left the Support team and helped the Publishing team by working with the Adobe Suite to build doc types from scratch.
                    After that I moved to the QA team where I got to test the product.</p>
                <p>When our largest client left, we were all laid off and the company was ultimately sold, so my takeaway is to ask future
                    employers - during the interview process - if they have multiple revenue streams. But it was lame, because I worked 
                    there for nearly 8 years.</p>

                <h3>Springbrook</h3>
                <p>My next job was working in downtown Portland for Springbrook as a Support Specialist. Before I got to my 90-day
                    review, I was contacted by an employer that was closer to home.</p>

                <h3>Axis Clinical Software</h3>
                <p>I interviewed at Axis and was ultimately hired, which I was happy for, because 3 months of battling rush hour
                    traffic was enough for me. At Axis, I began as a Support Specialist, I remoted into systems, tested patches,
                    assisted QA with regression testing, worked on the AWS platform, and learned to backup and migrate data.</p>
                <p>After an associate left the QA team, I was asked to join, which I did. I was responsible for learning about
                    software requirements, and I tested both the electronic and flagship versions of PATS (medical software).</p>
                <p>The company was working in the red for a long time, before they decided to cut all their staff, except for a few developers.
                    I hear the plan was to build a more modern product, which is part of what has compelled  me to learn.  I figure if I 
                    learn enough, it'll be that much harder to be laid off in this volatile industry.</p>
